#### I used code from the following for...
#### Selection Sort:     https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-for-selection-sort/ 
#### Merge Sort:         https://www.sanfoundry.com/python-program-implement-merge-sort/

# selection sort analysis

expected best:      n^2
expected worst:     n^2
expected average:   n^2

# insertion sort analysis

expected best:      n
expected worst:     n^2
expected average:   n^2

# merge sort analysis 

expected best:      n*log(n)
expected worst:     n*log(n)
expected average:   n*log(n)

selection sort, merge sort, and insertion sort time complexity analysis via python
